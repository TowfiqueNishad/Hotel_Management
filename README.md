# Hotel-Management
A backend API for hotel management that is lightweight and modular, created with Flask and MySQL. Core hotel operations, such as room administration, guest handling, reservations, billing, and staff workflow, are demonstrated in this project. Clean architecture makes it ideal for learning backend development or expanding into a fully functional production system.
